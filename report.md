## Step 1 - Dive into Cassandra

The first step was to learn about Cassandra, its uses, how it works and basic operations. Many sources were considerated and tested, from books to online tutorials. The final choice was the online classes provided by [Kiyu Gabriel at Datastax Academy](https://academy.datastax.com/courses/ds201-cassandra-core-concepts). This course taught me the core concepts, basic CLQ and how to perform stress tests and monitoring.
